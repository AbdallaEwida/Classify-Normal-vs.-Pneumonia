# Classify-Normal-vs.-Pneumonia
This project involves building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images as either normal or indicating pneumonia. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model creation using TensorFlow, training, evaluation, and prediction steps, with visualizations of sample images and results.
